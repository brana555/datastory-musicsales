        <mt>Music sales in different formats over the years 
        </mt>
        <p>
            Have you noticed how throughout the years, people have changed the way they listen to music?
            I hope to show the rapid increase and decline of certain forms of listening to music. 
            Our first visualisation below shows the U.S music sales from 1973 to 2019. 
            The data is from Kaggle which uses information from the RIAA.

         <p>
            There are 3 interactive visualisations within the tableau story that display the data and trends throughout the years.
            The area chart and stacked bar chart show the trends of sales in each music format whereas the pie chart shows the distribution of sales in each year of each format.
            You can select certain formats or different years to compare between them.
            As you can see, between 1973 and 1985, cassettes, 8-tracks, and vinyls were predominately sold as that was where the technology was at.
            Then between, 1985 and 2005, most of the sales as well as the highest number of sales were from CD's and a small amount from cassettes.
            However, after 2005, sales of those formats dramatically decreased as alternative formats started emerging at the same time as the internet.
            Most noteably, streaming services were rapidly driving up in sales as physical formats for have dwindled. In 2019, 80% of the music sales came from music streaming, when at 2010, it was only 7%.
            Music streaming services have taken over the way most people listen to music and it is looking like it will only get bigger.
            It seems that the more techonology advances, the quicker the change in the format in which we listen to music. When CDs were being sold, that is when the most amount of money was being made (peak at around $20 billion) as it was cheap to produce, and had better storage capabilities than a cassette or 8 track. We do also have to consider inflation when dealing with currency spanning decades.

            As you can see by the visualisation below. Spotify is the most downloaded music app worldwide on android in 2021. Spotify is a popular music streaming service, as well as Youtube Music and Soundcloud. Howver each platform has their slight differences and catalogue of music.
            In the second slide, a poll to the US audience in 2020 Q1 asked what features were most important for a streaming to have. 
            The 3 main features desired are quality of sound, price and simplicity in the streaming service.

        <mt>Spotify</mt>

        <p>
            Spotify is one of the most popular stream services in the market. The visualisation below shows the yearly number of spotify subscribers,
            split into normal users (who has to go through advertiments) and premium users (advertisement free). The next slide shows the yearly revenue of spotify split into ad-support and from premium accounts.
            
        </p>

        <div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1642162489736' style='position: relative'><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='spotifytableau&#47;Story1' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en-US' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1642162489736');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='1350px';vizElement.style.height='991px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>

        <p>
            From the visualisations, we can see that there are more normal users who have to go through advertisements than premium users. However, the difference is not by alot and is shortening by the year.
            The number of spotify users overall are increasing significantly year by year. In terms of revenue for spotify, it is also increasing significantly year by year.
            Noticeably, even though more than half of spotify users are not premium members, the vast majority of spotify's revenue is from premium members. In 2020, non-fee paying subscribers who are given ads instead make up only 9.4% of the total revenue in that year.
            However, the percentage of revenue generated from ads is increasing slighty each year. Amazingly, spotify generated 7.8 billion euros in revenue in total in 2020 as well as having 380 million users. This shows how big streaming services have become, not forgeting other big competitors such as Apple music and soundcloud.
        
            </p>

            <p>
            These visualisations show that streaming services are significantly increasing in use and generating revenue. Streaming sites is the format that our generation will listen to music for the coming years. It will be interesting to see if there will be any new technology that will supersede streaming services.
